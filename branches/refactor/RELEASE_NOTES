OpenWIPS-ng (www.OpenWIPS-ng.org)
---------------------------------

OpenWIPS-ng is an open source and modular 
Wireless IPS (Intrusion Prevention System). 

It is composed of three parts:
 * Sensor(s): 
    "Dumb" devices who capture the wireless traffic 
    and send it to the server for analysis.
    Also responds to attacks.
 * Server:
    Aggregates the data from all sensors, analyze it
    and respond to attacks. It also logs and alert in
    case of an attack.
 * Interface:
    GUI to manage the server and display informations
    about the threats on your wireless network(s).


Limitations
- The interface is not available yet.
- It doesn't go into the background yet (will be implemented for v1.0 final).
- Limited to one sensor connection (it will accept more but the result is unexpected)
- Sensor and server CPU architecture must be the same (will be fixed for v1.0 final).
- The sensor/server doesn't respond to threats yet (will be implemented for v1.0 final).
- There is a limited number of plugins. More will come.
- Recommended to use with a mac80211 driver (others will be implemented for v1.0 final).
- Traffic between sensor and server is not encrypted (yet).

Others things:
- Default user and password for the sensor is sensor1/sensor1 (it goes without saying it
  highly recommended to change it). Use -m to generate the hash and update the configuration file.
- If you want to develop a plugin, there is a parameter that can check if the plugin is valid: -p
  The documentation is in server/plugins.c.
- The server configuration file can be validated using -c
- IRC: #OpenWIPS-ng on freenode.net

Bugs
- It should be stable but since it is a beta version and hasn't been fully tested on
  a large number of different machines, expect bugs.
- How to report?
  * First, check if it hasn't been fixed in SVN
  * Recompile with 'make DEBUG=normal'. It will record all the frames 
    to a capture files and display more information on the screen.
  * If possible, run it with valgrind (default options are enough).
  * Include 'uname -a' output for both server and server (only once if they're on the same machine).
  * Don't forget to specify what revision if you are using. It is very important.
- The more information you provide, the more chance I have to find the bug quickly and fix it.
- If you can fix it, it's even better. I just need a patch done with 'diff -ur' or 'svn diff'. Don't forget to sign off the patch. 
- A bug tracker will be available soon. In the meantime, please email me at tdotreppe@openwips-ng.org or find me on IRC (Mister_X)
