This is an alpha release of OpenWIPS-ng (sensor and server).

Please do not offer this code for download, this is an alpha release.
But if you have any question, feel free to ask them in the IRC channel #openwips-ng or to tdotreppe@aircrack-ng.org
Although I ask not to offer it for download, this is going to be opensource, so if you
have any question about it, don't hesitate to mention some code/configuration/output 
if that can help solving a problem or understanding a question

Limitations
- It doesn't go into the background yet
- Limited to one sensor connection
- Sensor and server CPU architecture must be the same (Should be fixed this week)
- The sensor doesn't send frames when it reconnects to the server (will be fixed this week)
- The sensor/server doesn't answer to threats (will be developped this week)
- There is a limited number of plugins. More will come.
- Recommended to use with a mac80211 driver (will be fixed this week)

Others things:
- It is recommended to compile it with 'make DEBUG=normal'. It will record all the frames 
   to a capture files and display more information on the screen. These informations are
   really useful when a bug happen and helps reproduce the bug and fix it.
- Attacks logging: you will have a lot of output on the screen when an attack happens,
  this is normal (will be fixed this week). It is because we can detect an attack very quickly
  with just a few frames (note that a single deauth from aireplay-ng sends in reality 128 or 256 frames)
- If you want to develop a plugin, there is a parameter that can check if the plugin is valid: -p
- The configuration file can be validated using -c

Thanks a lot for testing this release. 
There will be bug fixes and improvements during the following week and you will receive updates (svn should be available soon).
